<P>Below a list of the known partition IDs (system indicators)
of the various operating systems, file systems, boot managers, etc.
For the various systems, short descriptions are given,
in the cases where I have some info.
There seem to be two other major such lists: Ralf Brown's
(see 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ralf/pub/WWW/files.html">interrupt list</A> under

and 
<A HREF="http://ata-atapi.com/hiwtab.htm">Hale Landis'</A>
but the present one is more correct and more complete.
(However, these two URLs are a valuable source for other information.)

<DT><B>01  DOS 12-bit FAT</B><DD><P>DOS is a family of single-user operating systems for PCs.
86-DOS (`QDOS' - Quick and Dirty OS) was a CP/M-like operating
system written by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (1979).
Microsoft bought it, renamed it to MS-DOS 1.0 and sold it to IBM (1980)
to be delivered together with the first IBM PCs (1981).
MS-DOS 2.0 (1983) was rather different, and designed to be somewhat
Unix-like. It supported a hard disk (up to 16MB; up to 32MB for version 2.1).
Version 3.3+ added the concept of partitions, where each partition is
at most 32MB. (Compaq DOS 3.31 relaxed this restriction.)
Since version 4.0 partitions can be 512 MB.
Version 5.0 supports partitions up to 2 GB.
Several clones exist:

(from Digital Research, later part of Novell and called NovellDOS or

then owned by Caldera and called
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/drdos/OpenDOS.701/">OpenDOS</A>,
then by its subsidiary Lineo who named it back to DR-DOS.

<DT><B>02  XENIX root</B><DD><P>
<P>
<DT><B>03  XENIX /usr</B><DD><P>Xenix is an old port of Unix V7.
Microsoft Xenix OS was announced August 1980, a portable and commercial
version of the Unix operating system for the Intel 8086, Zilog Z8000,
Motorola M68000 and Digital Equipment PDP-11.
Microsoft introduces XENIX 3.0 in April 1983.
(

SCO delivered its first Xenix for 8088/8086 in 1983.

<DT><B>04  DOS 3.0+ 16-bit FAT (up to 32M)</B><DD><P>Matthias Paul writes: Some old DOS versions have had a bug which requires this
partition to be located in the 1st physical 32 MB of the hard disk, hence
for compatibility with these old issues, partitions located elsewhere
should better be assigned the ID FAT16B (06h).
<P>
<DT><B>05  DOS 3.3+ Extended Partition</B><DD><P>Supports at most 8.4 GB disks: with type <B>05</B> DOS/Windows will not use
the extended BIOS call, even if it is available. See type <B>0f</B> below.
Using type <B>05</B> for extended partitions beyond 8 GB may lead
to data corruption with MSDOS.
<P>An extended partition is a box containing a linked list of logical
partitions. This chain (linked list) can have arbitrary length, but
some FDISK versions refuse to make more logical partitions than there
are drive letters available (e.g. MS-DOS LASTDRIVE=26 is good for at
most 24 disk partitions; Novell DOS 7+ allows LASTDRIVE=32).
<P>
<DT><B>06  DOS 3.31+ 16-bit FAT (over 32M)</B><DD><P>Partitions, or at least the FAT16 filesystems created on them,
are at most 2 GB for DOS and Windows 95/98 (at most 65536 clusters,
each at most 32 KB).
Windows NT can create up to 4 GB FAT16 filesystems (using 64 KB clusters),
but these cause problems for DOS and Windows 95/98.
Note that VFAT is 16-bit FAT with long filenames; FAT32 is a different
filesystem.

OS/2 will only look at partitions with ID 7 for any installed
IFS (that's why the EXT2.IFS packet includes a special "Linux
partition filter" device driver to fool OS/2 into thinking Linux
partitions have ID 07). (Kai Henningsen (<CODE>kai@khms.westfalen.de</CODE>))

The last versions are V3.2 for 286-386-486 and V4.0

Stephen Collins reports a 12 MB partition with ID 12 on a Compaq 7330T.
Tigran A. Aivazian reports a 40 MB partition with ID 12 on a
64 MB Compaq Proliant 1600.
ID 12 is used by the Compaq Contura to denote its hibernation partition.
(dan@fch.wimsey.bc.ca)
<P>NCR has used ID 0x12 MS-DOS partitions for diagnostics and
firmware support on their WorldMark systems since the mid-90s.
DataLight's ROM-DOS has replaced MS-DOS on more recent systems.
Partition sizes were once 72M (MS-DOS) but are now 40M (ROM-DOS).
<P>Intel has begun offering ROM-DOS based "Service Partition" support
on many OEM systems. This support initially used ID 0x98 but has
recently changed to ID 0x12. Intel provides their own support for
this partition in the form of a System Resource CD. Partition size
has remained constant at 40M. See e.g.

to the PC done by Bill Jolitz around 1991. When Jolitz seemed to

The outcome of a Novell vs. UCB law suit was that Net/2 contained
AT&amp;T code, and hence was not free, but that 4.4BSD-Lite was free.
After that, FreeBSD and NetBSD were restructured, and FreeBSD 2.0
and NetBSD 1.0 are based on 4.4BSD-Lite.
FreeBSD runs on PCs. See

Windows NT Disk Administrator marks hidden partitions (i.e. present but
not to be accessed) as type 0xfe. A primary partition of this type is also
used by IBM to hold an image of the "Reference Diskettes" on many of their
machines, particularly newer PS/2 systems (at a rough guess, anything built
after about 1994). This clash can cause major confusion and grief
if running NT on IBM kit.
When this Reference Partition is activated, it changes its type into 1
(FAT12) and hides all other partitions by adding 0x10 to the type.

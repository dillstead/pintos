@chapter Project 4: File Systems

In the previous two assignments, you made extensive use of a
file system without actually worrying about how it was implemented
underneath.  For this last assignment, you will fill in the
implementation of the file system.  You will be working primarily in
the @file{filesys} directory.

You may build project 4 on top of project 2 or project 3.  In either
case, all of the functionality needed for project 2 must work in your
filesys submission.  If you build on project 3, then all of the project
3 functionality must work also, and you will need to edit
@file{filesys/Make.vars} to enable VM functionality.  A small amount of
extra credit is available if you do build on project 3.

@node File System New Code
@subsection New Code

Here are some files that are probably new to you.  These are in the
@file{filesys} directory except where indicated:

@table @file
@item fsutil.c
Simple utilities for the file system that are accessible from the
kernel command line.

@item filesys.h
@itemx filesys.c
Top-level interface to the file system.  @xref{Using the File System},
for an introduction.

@item directory.h
@itemx directory.c
Translates file names to inodes.  The directory data structure is
stored as a file.

@item inode.h
@itemx inode.c
Manages the data structure representing the layout of a
file's data on disk.

@item file.h
@itemx file.c
Translates file reads and writes to disk sector reads
and writes.

@item lib/kernel/bitmap.h
@itemx lib/kernel/bitmap.c
A bitmap data structure along with routines for reading and writing
the bitmap to disk files.
@end table

Our file system has a Unix-like interface, so you may also wish to
read the Unix man pages for @code{creat}, @code{open}, @code{close},
@code{read}, @code{write}, @code{lseek}, and @code{unlink}.  Our file
system has calls that are similar, but not identical, to these.  The
file system translates these calls into physical disk operations.  

All the basic functionality is there in the code above, so that the
file system is usable from the start, as you've seen
in the previous two projects.  However, it has severe limitations
which you will remove.

While most of your work will be in @file{filesys}, you should be
prepared for interactions with all previous parts (as usual).

@node Project 4 Design Document
@subsection Design Document

Before you turn in your project, you must copy @uref{filesys.tmpl, , the
project 4 design document template} into your source tree under the name
@file{pintos/src/filesys/DESIGNDOC} and fill it in.  We recommend that
you read the design document template before you start working on the
project.  @xref{Project Documentation}, for a sample design document
that goes along with a fictitious project.

@node Indexed and Extensible Files
@subsection Indexed and Extensible Files

The basic file system allocates files as a single extent, making it
vulnerable to external fragmentation.  Eliminate this problem by
modifying the on-disk inode structure.  In practice, this probably means using
an index structure with direct, indirect, and doubly indirect blocks.
(You are welcome to choose a different scheme as long as you explain the
rationale for it in your design documentation, and as long as it does
not suffer from external fragmentation.)

You can assume that the disk will not be larger than 8 MB.  You must
support files as large as the disk (minus metadata).  Each inode is
stored in one disk sector, limiting the number of block pointers that it
can contain.  Supporting 8 MB files will require you to implement
doubly-indirect blocks.

An extent-based file can only grow if it is followed by empty space, but
with indexed inodes file growth is possible whenever free space is
available.  Implement file growth.  In the basic file system, the file
size is specified when the file is created.  In UNIX and most other file
systems, a file is initially created with size 0 and is then expanded
every time a write is made off the end of the file.  Your file system
must allow this.

There should be no predetermined limit on the size of a file, except
that a disk cannot exceed the size of the disk (minus metadata).  This
also applies to the root directory file, which should now be allowed
to expand beyond its initial limit of 16 files.

The user is allowed to seek beyond the current end-of-file (EOF).  The
seek itself does not extend the file.  Writing at a position past EOF
extends the file to the position being written, and any gap between the
previous EOF and the start of the write must be filled with zeros.  A
read starting from a position past EOF returns no bytes.

Writing far beyond EOF can cause many blocks to be entirely zero.  Some
file systems allocate and write real data blocks for these implicitly
zeroed blocks.  Other file systems do not allocate these blocks at all
until they are explicitly written.  The latter file systems are said to
support ``sparse files.''  You may adopt either allocation strategy in
your file system.

@node Subdirectories
@subsection Subdirectories

Implement a hierarchical name space.  In the basic file system, all
files live in a single directory.  Modify this to allow directory
entries to point to files or to other directories.

Make sure that directories can expand beyond their original size just
as any other file can.  

The basic file system has a 14-character limit on file names.  You may
retain this limit for individual file name components, or may extend
it, at your option.  You must allow full path names to be
much longer than 14 characters.

The current directory is maintained separately for each process.  At
startup, the initial process's current directory is the root directory.
When one process starts another with the @code{exec} system call, the
child process inherits its parent's current directory.  After that, the
two processes' current directories are independent, so that either
changing its own current directory has no effect on the other.

Update the existing system calls so that, anywhere a file name is
provided by the caller, an absolute or relative path name may used.

Update the @code{remove} system call so that it can delete empty
directories in addition to regular files.  Directories can only be
deleted if they do not contain any files or subdirectories.

Implement the following new system calls:

@deftypefn {System Call} bool chdir (const char *@var{dir})
Changes the current working directory of the process to
@var{dir}, which may be relative or absolute.  Returns true if
successful, false on failure.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {System Call} bool mkdir (const char *@var{dir})
Creates the directory named @var{dir}, which may be
relative or absolute.  Returns true if successful, false on failure.
Fails if @var{dir} already exists or if any directory name in
@var{dir}, besides the last, does not already exist.  That is,
@code{mkdir("/a/b/c")} succeeds only if @file{/a/b} already exists and
@file{/a/b/c} does not.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {System Call} void lsdir (void)
Prints a list of files in the current directory to @code{stdout}, one
per line, in no particular order.
@end deftypefn

We have provided @command{ls} and @command{mkdir} user programs, which
are straightforward once the above syscalls are implemented.  In Unix,
these are programs rather than built-in shell commands, but
@command{cd} is a shell command.

The @code{pintos} @option{put} and @option{get} commands should now
accept full path names, assuming that the directories used in the
paths have already been created.  This should not require any extra
effort on your part.

You may support @file{.} and @file{..} for a small amount of extra
credit.

@node Buffer Cache
@subsection Buffer Cache

Modify the file system to keep a cache of file blocks.  When a request
is made to read or write a block, check to see if it is stored in the
cache, and if so, fetch it immediately from the cache without going to
disk.  Otherwise, fetch the block from disk into cache, evicting an
older entry if necessary.  You are limited to a cache no greater than 64
sectors in size.

Be sure to choose an intelligent cache replacement algorithm.
Experiment to see what combination of accessed, dirty, and other
information results in the best performance, as measured by the number
of disk accesses.  For example, metadata is generally more valuable to
cache than data.

You can keep a cached copy of the free map permanently in memory if you
like.  It doesn't have to count against the cache size.

The provided inode code uses a ``bounce buffer'' allocated with
@func{malloc} to translate the disk's sector-by-sector interface into
the system call interface's byte-by-byte interface.  You should get rid
of these bounce buffers.  Instead, copy data into and out of sectors in
the buffer cache directly.

Your implementation should also include the following features:

@table @b
@item write-behind:
Keep dirty blocks in the cache, instead of immediately writing modified
data to disk.  Write dirty blocks to disk whenever they are evicted.
Because write-behind makes your file system more fragile in the face of
crashes, in addition you should periodically write all dirty, cached
blocks back to disk.  The cache should also be written back to disk in
@func{filesys_done}, so that halting Pintos flushes the cache.

If you have @func{timer_sleep} from the first project working, this is
an excellent application for it.  If you're still using the base
implementation of @func{timer_sleep}, be aware that it busy-waits, which
is not an acceptable solution. If @func{timer_sleep}'s delays seem too
short or too long, reread the explanation of the @option{-r} option to
@command{pintos} (@pxref{Debugging versus Testing}).

@item read-ahead:
Your buffer cache should automatically fetch the next block of a file
into the cache when one block of a file is read, in case that block is
about to be read.

Read-ahead is only really useful when done asynchronously.  That means,
if a process requests disk block 1 from the file, it should block until disk
block 1 is read in, but once that read is complete, control should
return to the process immediately.  The read-ahead request for disk
block 2 should be handled asynchronously, in the background.
@end table

@node File System Synchronization
@subsection Synchronization

The provided file system requires external synchronization, that is,
callers must ensure that only one thread can be running in the file
system code at once.  Your submission must adopt a finer-grained
synchronization strategy that does not require external synchronization.
To the extent possible, operations on independent entities should be
independent, so that they do not need to wait on each other.

Operations on different cache blocks must be independent.  In
particular, when I/O is required on a particular block, operations on
other blocks that do not require I/O should proceed without having to
wait for the I/O to complete.

Multiple processes must be able to access a single file at once.
Multiple reads of a single file must be able to complete without
waiting for one another.  When writing to a file does not extend the
file, multiple processes should also be able to write a single file at
once.  A read of a file by one process when the file is being written by
another process is allowed to show that none, all, or part of the write
has completed.  (However, after the @code{write} system call returns to
its caller, all subsequent readers must see the change.)  Similarly,
when two processes simultaneously write to the same part of a file,
their data may be interleaved.

On the other hand, extending a file and writing data into the new
section must be atomic.  Suppose processes A and B both have a given
file open and both are positioned at end-of-file.  If A reads and B
writes the file at the same time, A may read all, part, or none of what
B writes.  However, A may not read data other than what B writes, e.g.@:
if B's data is all nonzero bytes, A is not allowed to see any zeros.

Operations on different directories should take place concurrently.
Operations on the same directory may wait for one another.

@item How much code will I need to write?

Here's a summary of our reference solution, produced by the
@command{diffstat} program.  The final row gives total lines inserted
and deleted; a changed line counts as both an insertion and a deletion.

This summary is relative to the Pintos base code, but we started from
the reference solution to project 3.  Thus, the reference solution runs
with virtual memory enabled.  @xref{Project 3 FAQ}, for the summary

@table @b
@item What is the largest file size that we are supposed to support?

will have to be smaller than the disk to accommodate the metadata.

@table @b
@item Why is @command{cd} a shell command?

The current directory of each process is independent.  A @command{cd}
program could change its own current directory, but that would have no
effect on the shell.  In fact, Unix-like systems don't provide any way
for one process to change another process's current working directory.
@end table

@node Buffer Cache FAQ
@subsection Buffer Cache FAQ

@table @b
@item Can we keep a @struct{inode_disk} inside @struct{inode}?

The goal of the 64-block limit is to bound the amount of cached file
system data.  If you keep a block of disk data---whether file data or
metadata---anywhere in kernel memory then you have to count it against
the 64-block limit.  The same rule applies to anything that's
``similar'' to a block of disk data, such as a @struct{inode_disk}
without the @code{length} or @code{sector_cnt} members.

That means you'll have to change the way the inode implementation
accesses its corresponding on-disk inode right now, since it currently
just embeds a @struct{inode_disk} in @struct{inode} and reads the
corresponding sector from disk when it's created.  Keeping extra
copies of inodes would subvert the 64-block limitation that we place
on your cache.

You can store a pointer to inode data in @struct{inode}, if you want,
and you can store other information to help you find the inode when you
need it.  Similarly, you may store some metadata along each of your 64
cache entries.

You can keep a cached copy of the free map permanently in memory if you
like.  It doesn't have to count against the cache size.

@func{byte_to_sector} in @file{filesys/inode.c} uses the
@struct{inode_disk} directly, without first reading that sector from
wherever it was in the storage hierarchy.  This will no longer work.
You will need to change @func{inode_byte_to_sector} so that it reads the
@struct{inode_disk} from the storage hierarchy before using it.
@end table

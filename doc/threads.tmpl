			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct'
>> member, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.
>> Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(), including
>> the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in the timer
>> interrupt handler?

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

>> How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs during a
>> call to timer_sleep()?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct'
>> member, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.
>> Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.  Use ASCII
>> art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for a lock,
>> semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire() causes a
>> priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called on a
>> lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain how
>> your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
			  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct'
>> member, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.
>> Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each has a
>> recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the scheduling
>> decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each thread after
>> each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run

>> Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values in the
>> table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve them?  Does
>> this match the behavior of your scheduler?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> Critique your design, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in
>> your design choices.  If you were to have extra time to work on this
>> part of the project, how might you choose to refine or improve your
>> design?

>> The assignment explains arithmetic for fixed-point math in detail, but
>> it leaves it open to you to implement it.  Why did you decide to
>> implement it the way you did?  If you created an abstraction layer for
>> fixed-point math, that is, an abstract data type and/or a set of
>> functions or macros to manipulate fixed-point numbers, why did you do
>> so?  If not, why not?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?

CORRECTNESS [[total]]
---------------------

Small files (< 63 kB)
  sm-create: create small file, verify initialization to zeros
  sm-full: write small file in single system call, reread to verify
  sm-seq-block: write small file one block at a time, reread to verify
  sm-seq-random: write small file a random amount at a time, reread to verify
  sm-random: write small file randomly, reread randomly to verify
Score: /5

Large files (>= 63 kB)
  lg-create: create large file, verify initialization to zeros
  lg-full: write large file in single system call, reread to verify
  lg-seq-block: write large file one block at a time, reread to verify
  lg-seq-random: write large file a random amount at a time, reread to verify
  lg-random: write large file randomly, reread randomly to verify
Score: /

File growth
  grow-create: create empty file, verify
  grow-seq-sm: extend empty file sequentially to small size, verify
  grow-seq-lg: extend empty file sequentially to large size, verify
  grow-sparse: create empty file, seek to 128 kB, write byte, verify zeroing
  grow-dir-sm: create 20 small files in a directory, 
  grow-dir-lg: create 200 small files in a directory
Score: /

Subdirectories and file management
  dir-mkdir: create directory and chdir into it
  dir-rmdir: create directory, remove directory, chdir into it must now fail
  dir-hier: create deep hierarchy of directories
  dir-rel-mkdir: mkdir /a, chdir /a, mkdir b, chdir b, create /a/b/c, open c
  dir-rel-open: mkdir /a, mkdir /a/b, create /a/b/c, chdir /a, open b/c
  dir-rel-rmdir: mkdir a, mkdir /a/b, chdir a, rmdir b
  dir-rel-remove: mkdir a, create /a/b, chdir a, remove b
  dir-abs-mkdir: mkdir /a, chdir /a, mkdir /b, create /b/c, chdir /b, open c
  dir-lsdir: lsdir must do something reasonable
Score: /

Synchronization
  syn-remove: read and write deleted file
  syn-mult-read: one process writes file, many read from it
  syn-mult-write: many processes write different parts of file, then verify

a) DESIGNDOC (/60 pts)
    a) Arg passing                                          (/10)
    b) System calls                                         (/20)
         Didn't discuss global vs local allocation of fileID's
         How to handle exceptions & why (ie killing processes
           that do bad things)
         Explaining choice of openFileID's & ASIDS
    c) Multiprogramming                                     (/30)
         How to find a free page.
         Explaining how new processes are executed.
         How they deal with running out of memory error on loading.

b) Other Design (/60 pts)

   1. Argument passing
      No checking for page boundaries in argument passing               -10
      Uses memcpy/bcopy/memmove or file reading/writing for             +5
        copying up to/starting from page boundaries -- good job!
        (Search for memcpy/bcopy, not just extern, make sure they call it
        with the possibility of copying more than 4 bytes at a time. ALSO if
        they do File Read/Writes then that is not byte-by-byte but they will
        fail page crossing only take off for failing the pagecrossing test.)
      Don't decomp / reuse translation code                             -5
      Using strtok instead of strtok_r or strsep                        -1
        (strtok is not thread-safe)

   2. System calls
      No checking for page boundaries in system calls                   -20
        (-5 if they only forgot for some system calls but did it somewhere)
      Interrupts turned off for all system calls                        -10
      Doesn't close open files after process exits                      -2
      table/when file is closed, it is not removed from file table
      Uses printf/fscanf/putc/getc when interacting                     -5
        with StandardInput / StandardOutput
      Using fixed length buffer for Read/Write                          -5
      Using pointer to int casts as ASID/FileId without justifying      -5

   3. Multiprogramming
      Don't use the bitmap object                                       -5
      Bitmap is not cleared when process dies                           -5
      Access to bitmap is not sychronized                               -5
      getting next ASID is not synchronized                             -5
        ...or (mututally exclusive, depending on their solution)...
      Doesn't use ASID's at all, but their system for identifying       -5
        processes has synchronization or uniqueness problems (e.g. 
        careless use of AddrSpace*'s)
      Multiple translations for a page                                  -10
        (One vaddr maps to two paddr's, or vice versa)

Style (/30 points)
------------------
0) Had to modify code to get to compile the first                       -10
   time
1) Minor changes to machine code                                        -10
2) Extraneous output                                                    -5
3) Unexplained dependencies                                             -5
4) Not Decomposing Exception handler                                    -5

TESTCASEs (/30 points)
----------------------
    Don't write own testcases                                           -15
    Not sufficient testing                                        up to -10

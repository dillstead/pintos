* Most code written by Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>.

* The original structure and form of this operating system is inspired
  by the Nachos system from the University of California, Berkeley.  A
  few of the source files are more-or-less literal translations of the
  Nachos C++ code into C.  These files bear the original UCB license
  notice.

* Some of the source code is derived from code used in the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 6.828 advanced operating
  systems course.  These files bear the original MIT license notice.

projects
--------

* The projects are primarily the creation of Ben Pfaff
  <blp@cs.stanford.edu>.

* Godmar Back <godmar@gmail.com> made significant contributions to
  project design.

* Although little remains unchanged, the projects were originally
  derived from those designed for Nachos by current and former CS140
  teaching assistants at Stanford University, including at least the
  following people:
	
	- Yu Ping <yph@cs.stanford.edu>

	- Greg Hutchins

	- Kelly Shaw <kashaw (at) cs.stanford.edu>, 

	- Paul Twohey <twohey AT cs DOT stanford DOT edu>

	- Sameer Qureshi <squreshi@cs.stanford.edu>

	- John Rector

  If you're not on this list but should be, please let me know.

* Example code for condition variables is from classroom slides
  originally by Dawson Engler and updated by Mendel Roseblum.
